# TroopJS TodoMVC Example

__An implementation of [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/) using [ToopJS](http://troopjs.com/)__

## Introduction

This project serves two purposes:

* Provide the community a well known demo application that features the style and features of TroopJS.
* Provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to write a simple TroopJS application.

## TodoMVC deviations from the specifications

For one reason or another there are parts of the application that deviates from the [original specifications](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/wiki/App-Specification). We've tried to stay as true as possible, but hey - nobody's perfect. The known deviations are:

*	> Use double-quotes in HTML and single-quotes in JS and CSS.

	We've opted to follow the guidelines of TroopJS rather than the ones from TodoMVC for exatly the same reasons they have it posted in their [code style](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/contributing.md#code-style)

	> We think it's best for the project if the code you write looks like the code the last developer wrote.

	We believe that's a great idea, but we want our project to look like any other _TroopJS_ project, so we've stuck with our code style for this application.

*	> Unless it conflicts with the project's best practices, your example should use bower for package management.

	For this example we're using git submodules for simple dependency management. There's a separate branch where we track the version of this application that we've submitted to TodoMVC and _that_ branch uses [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) for dependency management.

*	> This checkbox toggles all the todos to the same state as itself. Make sure to clear the checked state after the the "Clear completed" button is clicked. The "Mark all as complete" checkbox should also be updated when single todo items are checked/unchecked. Eg. When all the todos are checked it should also get checked.

	Since the specification does not define what this checkbox should do when only _some_ of the tasks are marked as completed, we've added an indeterminate state that covers this usecase.

## Tutorial

This part of the document gives you a step-by-step tutorial on how the todo application was written.

### Directory structure

Before we look at any code we'll take you through the (recommended) directory structure for a TroopJS application.

```
.
├── dist
├── css
├── js
│   └── lib
└── test
```

As you and see all application sources are contained in a top `js` folder. In the `test` you'll find test, and the `dist` folder we'll get the build output (note that the `dist` folder should be created by a build tool and ignored from source control).

Inside the `js` folder there's a folder called `lib`. This is where external _application_ libraries should be stored. External libraries should be [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) compliant.

> TroopJS makes use of git submodules to manage external libraries. For instructions on how submodules work you can take a look at the [documentation](http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html).

### Bootstrap

As previously noted the application resources are all contained in the `js` folder. In this folder there are a couple of _standard_ folders that most applications would need

```
├── js
│   ├── lib
│   └── widget
├── css
└── img
```

It's also recommended that there's a `index.html` (the application landing-page).

So before we start we'll create a skeleton structure and add the external libraries needed for TroopJS to function.

After this is done the directory structure will look something like this (folders marked with `*` are git sub-modules)

```
├── bower_components       (*)
├── css
├── js
│   ├── lib
│   │   ├── jquery         (*)
│   │   ├── requirejs      (*)
│   │   └── troopjs-bundle (*)
│   └── widget
└── img
```

So now we can start with our todo application. The first thing we should do is to copy the [template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/template) resources to the correct locations. Once we're done with this we'll take a look at index.html

```html

```

> TroopJS uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for its dependency management. The recommended way to bootstrap a RequireJS application is described [here](http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html#add), but we're using an alternative way to configure RequireJS described [here](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config) whereby we define the config as the global variable `require` __before__ `require.js` is loaded.

Let's add the configuration (inside a `script` tag right before the script that includeds `js/app`)

```javascript
"use strict";
var require = {
	"baseUrl" : "js",

	"packages" : [{
		"name" : "jquery",
		"location" : "lib/jquery",
		"main" : "dist/jquery"
	}, {
		"name" : "poly",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/poly",
		"main" : "poly"
	}, {
		"name" : "when",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/when",
		"main" : "when"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-core",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-core/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-browser",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-browser/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-data",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-data/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-jquery",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-jquery/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-requirejs",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-requirejs/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-utils",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-utils/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-bundle",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle",
		"main" : "build/maxi"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-todos",
		"location" : ".",
		"main" : "application.min"
	}],

	"map" : {
		"*" : {
			"template" : "troopjs-requirejs/template"
		}
	},

	"deps" : [ "require", "jquery" ],

	"callback" : function Boot (contextRequire, jQuery) {
		contextRequire([ "troopjs-browser/application/widget", "troopjs-browser/route/widget" ], function Strap (Application, RouteWidget) {
			jQuery(function ($) {
				Application($("html"), "bootstrap", RouteWidget($(window), "route")).start();
			});
		});
	}
};
```

Lets review

*	```javascript
	"use strict";
	```

	Tell the javascript interpreter that we run this in strict mode.

*	```javascript
	var require = {
	```

	Start configuring RequireJS

	> RequireJS supports a [configuration object as the as the global variable require](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config).

*	```javascript
	"baseUrl" : "js",
	```

	Set the `baseUrl` to `js`.

	> __baseUrl__: the root path to use for all module lookups. So in the above example, "my/module"'s script tag will have a src="/another/path/my/module.js". baseUrl is not used when loading plain .js files, those strings are used as-is, so a.js and b.js will be loaded from the same directory as the HTML page that contains the above snippet.
	>
	> If no baseUrl is explicitly set in the configuration, the default value will be the location of the HTML page that loads require.js. If a data-main attribute is used, that path will become the baseUrl.
	>
	> The baseUrl can be a URL on a different domain as the page that will load require.js. RequireJS script loading works across domains. The only restriction is on text content loaded by text! plugins: those paths should be on the same domain as the page, at least during development. The optimization tool will inline text! plugin resources so after using the optimization tool, you can use resources that reference text! plugin resources from another domain.

*	```javascript
	"packages" : [{
		"name" : "jquery",
		"location" : "lib/jquery",
		"main" : "dist/jquery"
	}, {
		"name" : "poly",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/poly",
		"main" : "poly"
	}, {
		"name" : "when",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/when",
		"main" : "when"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-core",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-core/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-browser",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-browser/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-data",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-data/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-jquery",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-jquery/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-requirejs",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-requirejs/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-utils",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-utils/src"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-bundle",
		"location" : "lib/troopjs-bundle",
		"main" : "build/maxi"
	}, {
		"name" : "troopjs-todos",
		"location" : ".",
		"main" : "application.min"
	}],
	```

	Configures loading modules from CommonJS packages.

	> __packages__: RequireJS supports loading modules that are in a [CommonJS Packages directory](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.1) structure, but some additional configuration needs to be specified for it to work. Specifically, there is support for the following CommonJS Packages features:
	>
	> * A package can be associated with a module name/prefix.
	> * The package config can specify the following properties for a specific package:
	>	* __name__: The name of the package (used for the module name/prefix mapping)
	>	* __location__: The location on disk. Locations are relative to the baseUrl configuration value, unless they contain a protocol or start with a front slash (/).
	>	* __main__: The name of the module inside the package that should be used when someone does a require for "packageName". The default value is "main", so only specify it if it differs from the default. The value is relative to the package folder.
	>
	> There's further information available in the RequireJS documentation about [Loading Modules from Packages](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#packages).

*	```javascript
	"deps": [ "require", "jquery" ]
	```

	Depend on `require` and `jquery`

	> __deps__: An array of dependencies to load. This is useful when require is defined as a config object before require.js is loaded, and you want to specify dependencies to load as soon as require() is defined.
	
*	```javascript
	"callback" : function Boot (contextRequire, jQuery) {
	```

	The callback that will be called after __deps__ have been resolved (in this case called `Boot`).

	> A function to execute after __deps__ have been loaded. Useful when require is defined as a config object before require.js is loaded, and you want to specify a function to require after the configuration's __deps__ array has been loaded.

*	```javascript
	contextRequire([ "troopjs-browser/application/widget", "troopjs-browser/route/widget" ], function Strap(Application, RouteWidget) {
	```

	Use the context require to load `troopjs-browser/application/widget` and `troopjs-browser/route/widget`, and once that is completed call the `Strap` function.

*	```javascript
	jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {
	```

	Add a standard ready handler to the document

*	```javascript
	Application($("html"), "bootstrap", RouteWidget($(window), "route")).start();
	```

	Create and attach the `bootstrap` application to `$("html")` and add a `RouteWidget` attached to `$(window)` as a child. Then `start` the application.

Now we've configure our application to use RequireJS and set up the application entry point.

### Adding some widgets

Lets go back and look at [`index.html`](index.html). We want to try to break out functionality into small (somewhat self-contained) widgets, and the natural place to start is adding and displaying todo items.

>	There are three main classes of modules in TroopJS
>
>	*	`component`s are the base building block of anything TroopJS
>	*	`gadget`s extend `component`s with methods like `publish` and `subscribe`
>	*	`widget`s extend `gadget`s with UI related methods like `html` and `after`

Let's do this by adding _weave_ instructions in the HTML using `data-weave` attributes.

*	```html
	<input id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?" autofocus data-weave="widget/create">
	```

*	```html
	<ul id="todo-list" data-weave="widget/list">
	```

>	TroopJS _weaves_ widgets to the DOM by traversing it and finding elements that have a `data-weave` attribute. When weaving an element TroopJS will:
>
>	* Locate (and if needed async load) the module containing the widget
>	* Instantiate the widget and attach the jQuery wrapped DOM element to the created instance
>	* Wire the instance (basically reflect on the instance and scan for well-known method signatures), more on this later

If you look at the modified [`index.html`](index.html) you can locate all the widgets simply by searching for the `data-weave` attribute on any element.

#### [Create widget](js/widget/create.js)

The first widget to deal with is the create widget

> Widgets are named after where they are located (relative to `baseUrl`) in the source tree. A general rule is to simply add `.js` to the widget name to locate the file, so `widget/create` can be found in `js/widget/create.js`

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-browser/component/widget" ], function CreateModule(Widget) {
	"use strict";

	var ENTER_KEY = 13;

	return Widget.extend({
		"dom/keyup": function onKeyUp($event) {
			var me = this;
			var $element = me.$element;
			var value;

			switch ($event.keyCode) {
				case ENTER_KEY:
					// Get $element value
					value = $element.val().trim();

					// Check that the value is not empty
					if (value !== "") {
						// Publish todos/add
						me.publish("todos/add", value)
							// When all handlers are done
							.then(function () {
								// Reset val
								$element.val("");
							});
					}
					break;
			}
		}
	});
});
```

Let's go through this widget

*	```javascript
	define([ "troopjs-browser/component/widget" ], function CreateModule(Widget) {
	```

	Start the definition of this module and declare its dependencies. The module is (internally) named `CreateModule` and it depends on `troopjs-browser/component/widget` which will be available inside the module as `Widget`

	> If you look above in `index.html` you'll find a package definition for `troopjs-browser` that points to `lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-browser/src`. This means that `troopjs-browser/...` actually resolves to `lib/troopjs-bundle/src/lib/troopjs-browser/src/...`

*	```javascript
	"use strict";
	```

	Be strict.

*	```javascript
	var ENTER_KEY = 13;
	```

	Declare a constant for `ENTER_KEY` corresponding to the `keyCode` of enter.

*	```javascript
	return Widget.extend({
	```

	The result of this module is extending `Widget`

*	```javascript
	"dom/keyup" : function onKeyUp($event) {
	```

	This is where wiring becomes important. As mentioned above, wiring scans for well-known method signatures, and `dom/*` is one of these. In this instance, we're indicating that we want to add a handler for the DOM `keyup` event.

	> For DOM handlers, the first argument is the original jQuery event object.

*	```javascript
	var me = this;
	var $element = me.$element;
	var value;
	
	switch ($event.keyCode) {
		case ENTER_KEY:
			// Get $element value
			value = $element.val().trim();

			// Check that the value is not empty
			if (value !== "") {
				// Publish todos/add
				me.publish("todos/add", value)
					// When all handlers are done
					.then(function () {
						// Reset val
						$element.val("");
					});
			}
			break;
	}
	```

	*	Save `this` as `me` so we can use it inside of closures
	*	Save `me.$element` (woven element) as `$element`
	*	Store the trimmed value of the element as `value`
	*	Check if the `keyCode` of the event was enter - if so `publish` `value` on `todos/add` and once all handlers are completed, reset `$element`.

#### [Count widget](js/widget/count.js)

Next we'll take a look at the count widget. This widget shows a counter that informs the user of how many active items are in the list.

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-browser/component/widget", "jquery" ], function CountModule(Widget, $) {
	use "strict";

	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && !item.completed;
	}

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
			var count = $.grep(items, filter).length;

			this.$element.html("<strong>" + count + "</strong> " + (count === 1 ? "item" : "items") + " left");
		}
	});
});
```

Let's look at what new things we can find.

*	```javascript
	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && !item.completed;
	}
	```

	A static filter later used by `$.grep` to count active items.

*	```javascript
	"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
	```

	Again with the well-known signatures. This signature tells TroopJS that we want to add a subscription to the `todos/change` topic, _and_ that if a previous value was published on this topic _before_ we added our subscription, we'd like to get a callback with that value (this is what `:memory` adds to the mix).

*	```javascript
	var count = $.grep(items, filter).length;
	```

	This filters the list to only contain active items. After that we count the number of items in the array and store as `count`.

*	```javascript
	this.$element.html("<strong>" + count + "</strong> " + (count === 1 ? "item" : "items") + " left");
	```

	Update the `$element` HTML with a pluralized (if needed) text indicating what the current `count` is.

#### [Clear widget](js/widget/clear.js)

The clear widget is quite similar to the count widget, but the opposite. Instead of counting the number of active items in the list, it counts the number of completed items in the list.

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-browser/component/widget", "jquery" ], function ClearModule(Widget, $) {
	use "strict";

	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && item.completed;
	}

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
			var count = $.grep(items, filter).length;

			this.$element.text("Clear completed (" + count + ")")[count > 0 ? "show" : "hide"]();
		},

		"dom/click" : function onClear() {
			this.publish("todos/clear");
		}
	});
});
```

What looks different here?

*	```javascript
	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && item.completed;
	}
	```

	Almost the same filter as before, but this time for completed items.

*	```javascript
	this.$element.text("Clear completed (" + count + ")")[count > 0 ? "show" : "hide"]();
	```

	Update the `$element` HTML with a pluralized (if needed) text indicating what the current `count` is and if the count is not greater than `0` then `hide`.

*	```javascript
	"dom/click" : function onClear() {
		this.publish("todos/clear");
	}
	```

	Register a click handler that will publish `todos/clear` on the pubsub every time it is invoked.

#### [Mark widget](js/widget/mark.js)

The mark widget can do two things

* It allows the user to mark all the items as either completed or active with one click
* It shows the aggregate status of all the items in the list
  * __Unchecked__ if _no_ items are completed
  * __Checked__ if _all_ items are completed
  * __Indedeterminate__ if _some_ items are completed

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-browser/component/widget" ], function MarkModule(Widget) {
	use "strict";

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
			var total = 0;
			var completed = 0;
			var $element = this.$element;

			$.each(items, function iterator(i, item) {
				if (item === null) {
					return;
				}

				if (item.completed) {
					completed++;
				}

				total++;
			});

			if (completed === 0) {
				$element
					.prop("indeterminate", false)
					.prop("checked", false);
			}
			else if (completed === total) {
				$element
					.prop("indeterminate", false)
					.prop("checked", true);
			}
			else {
				$element
					.prop("indeterminate", true)
					.prop("checked", false);
			}
		},

		"dom/change" : function onMark($event) {
			this.publish("todos/mark", $($event.target).prop("checked"));
		}
	});
});

```

Let's start with the first item, showing an aggregate status

*	```javascript
	"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
	```

	First register a handler for `todos/change`. You should recognize this by now as any widget interesting in changes of the list have handlers registered for this topic.

*	```javascript
	var total = 0;
	var completed = 0;
	var $element = this.$element;

	$.each(items, function iterator(i, item) {
		if (item === null) {
			return;
		}

		if (item.completed) {
			completed++;
		}

		total++;
	});
	```

	Iterate `items` to determine how many non `null` items are there in `total` and how many of them are `completed`.

*	```javascript
	if (completed === 0) {
		$element
			.prop("indeterminate", false)
			.prop("checked", false);
	}
	else if (completed === total) {
		$element
			.prop("indeterminate", false)
			.prop("checked", true);
	}
	else {
		$element
			.prop("indeterminate", true)
			.prop("checked", false);
	}
	```

	Update the `$element` `indeterminate` and `checked` properties to reflect the result.

And then the second item - batch interaction:

*	```javascript
	"dom/change" : function onMark($event) {
		this.publish("todos/mark", $($event.target).prop("checked"));
	}
	```

	Register a change handler that will publish `todos/mark` on the pubsub with the current `checked` status of the checkbox as an argument.

#### [Filters widget](js/widget/filters.js)

The filters widget reflects the current filter status and allows the user to apply filters to the list.

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-browser/component/widget", "jquery" ], function FiltersModule(Widget, $) {
	use "strict";

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/route" : function onRoute(uri) {
			this.publish("todos/filter", uri.source);
		},

		"hub:memory/todos/filter" : function onFilter(filter) {
			filter = filter || "/";

			// Update UI
			$("a[href^='#']")
				.removeClass("selected")
				.filter("[href='#" + filter + "']")
				.addClass("selected");
		}
	});
});
```

Let's take a closer look

*	```javascript
	"hub:memory/route" : function onRoute(uri) {
		this.publish("todos/filter", uri.source);
	},
	```

	This will register a handler for the `route` topic that will republish `uri.source` on `todos/filter`. The `route` topic is published on each time the route (anything after `#` in the url) changes. The `uri` object is a parsed version of the route. Also note the `:memory` part that ensures we always get the latest value published on this topic.

*	```javascript
	"hub:memory/todos/filter" : function onFilter(filter) {
		filter = filter || "/";

		// Update UI
		$("a[href^='#']")
			.removeClass("selected")
			.filter("[href='#" + filter + "']")
			.addClass("selected");
	}
	```

	Registers a handler for the `todos/filter` topic (that we publish above). Sets the default filter (if none is provided) to `/` then finds all child elements matching the css selector `a[href^='#']` (an anchor element where the `href` attribute starts with `#`) then either add or remove the `selected` css class (depending on if the filter matches).

#### [Display widget](js/widget/display.js)

The display widget shows or hides its contents depending on the status of the list

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-browser/component/widget", "jquery" ], function DisplayModule(Widget, $) {
	use "strict";

	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null;
	}

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/todos/change": function onChange(items) {
			this.$element[$.grep(items, filter).length > 0 ? "show" : "hide"]();
		}
	});
});
```

Quite simply it registers a handler for `todos/change` that will either `show` or `hide` depending on the `count` of the filtered array returned from `$.grep`.

#### [List widget](js/widget/list.js)

The list widget is where all the magic happens. It is by far the largest widget and it contains all the logic that deals with the list.
