# TroopJS TodoMVC Example

__An implementation of [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/) using [ToopJS](http://troopjs.com/)__

## Introduction

This project serves two purposes:

* Provide the community a well known demo application that features the style and features of TroopJS.
* Provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to write a simple TroopJS application.

## TodoMVC deviations from the specifications

For one reason or another there are parts of the application that deviates from the [original specifications](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/wiki/App-Specification). We've tried to stay as true as possible, but hey - nobody's perfect. The known deviations are:

*	> Use double-quotes in HTML and single-quotes in JS and CSS.

	We've opted to follow the guidelines of TroopJS rather than the ones from TodoMVC for exatly the same reasons they have it posted in their [code style](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/contributing.md#code-style)

	> We think it's best for the project if the code you write looks like the code the last developer wrote.

	We believe that's a great idea, but we want our project to look like any other _TroopJS_ project, so we've stuck with our code style for this application.

*	> This checkbox toggles all the todos to the same state as itself. Make sure to clear the checked state after the the "Clear completed" button is clicked. The "Mark all as complete" checkbox should also be updated when single todo items are checked/unchecked. Eg. When all the todos are checked it should also get checked.

	Since the specification does not define what this checkbox should do when only _some_ of the tasks are marked as completed, we've added an indeterminate state that covers this usecase.

## Tutorial

This part of the document gives you a step-by-step tutorial on how the todo application was written.

### Directory structure

Before we look at any code we'll take you through the (recommended) directory structure for a TroopJS application.

```
.
├── (dist)
├── bower_components
├── index.html
├── bower.json
├── app.js
├── css
├── widget
├── service
└── test
```

As you can see all non-source modules and other dependencies installed by bower will live in the `bower_components` directory.

Each application component should be placed in a directory structure reflecting it's module name,
starting from the application root directory, no intermediate folder (like src/js) needs to be created.
This guarantees that TroopJS application/component package whether in source or built format, can be consumed by other packages
without having to relocate the AMD package directory.

E.g . a TroopJS component lives in module `troopjs-todos/widget/list` shall have a directory structure of:
```
└── widget
    └── list.js
```

In the `test` you'll find test, and the `dist` folder is where we produce the build output (note that the `dist` folder should be created by a build tool and ignored from source control).

It's also recommended that there's a `index.html` (the application landing-page).

### Bootstrap

So now we can start with our todo application. The first thing we should do is to copy the [template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/template) resources to the correct locations. Once we're done with this we'll take a look at index.html

```html

```

> TroopJS uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for its dependency management. The recommended way to bootstrap a RequireJS application is described [here](http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html#add), but we're using an alternative way to configure RequireJS described [here](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config) whereby we define the config as the global variable `require` __before__ `require.js` is loaded.

Let's add the bootstrap code including module configuration and application start inside the file `app.js`.

```javascript
"use strict";

require.config({
	"baseUrl": "bower_components",
	"packages": [
		{
			name: "'jquery'",
			main: 'jquery.js'
		},
		{
			name: "'poly'",
			main: 'poly.js'
		},
		{
			name: "'requirejs'",
			main: 'require.js'
		},
		{
			name: "'when'",
			main: 'when.js'
		},
		{
			name: 'troopjs-todos',
			location: '../'
		}
	],

	"map": {
		"*": {
			"template": "mu-template/plugin",
			"text": "requirejs-text/text",
			"config": "app/config"
		}
	},

	"deps" : [ "require", "jquery" ],

	"callback" : function Boot (contextRequire, jQuery) {
		contextRequire([ "troopjs-dom/application/widget", "troopjs-dom/hash/widget", "when/monitor/console" ],
			function Strap(Application, HashWidget) {
				jQuery(function($) {
					Application($("html"), "bootstrap", HashWidget($(window))).start();
				});
			});
	}
});
```

Lets review

*	```javascript
	"use strict";
	```

	Tell the javascript interpreter that we run this in strict mode.

*	```javascript
	var require = {
	```

	Start configuring RequireJS

	> RequireJS supports a [configuration object as the as the global variable require](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config).

*	```javascript
	"baseUrl" : "bower_components",
	```

	Set the `baseUrl` to `bower_components`.

	> __baseUrl__: the root path to use for all module lookups. So in the above example, "my/module"'s script tag will have a src="/another/path/my/module.js". baseUrl is not used when loading plain .js files, those strings are used as-is, so a.js and b.js will be loaded from the same directory as the HTML page that contains the above snippet.
	>
	> If no baseUrl is explicitly set in the configuration, the default value will be the location of the HTML page that loads require.js. If a data-main attribute is used, that path will become the baseUrl.
	>
	> The baseUrl can be a URL on a different domain as the page that will load require.js. RequireJS script loading works across domains. The only restriction is on text content loaded by text! plugins: those paths should be on the same domain as the page, at least during development. The optimization tool will inline text! plugin resources so after using the optimization tool, you can use resources that reference text! plugin resources from another domain.

*	```javascript
	"packages": [
		{
			name: "jquery",
			main: "jquery.js"
		},
		{
			name: "poly",
			main: "poly.js"
		},
		{
			name: "requirejs",
			main: "require.js"
		},
		{
			name: "when",
			main: "when.js"
		},
		{
			name: "troopjs-todos",
			location: "../"
		}
	],
	```
	Configures loading modules from CommonJS packages.

	> __packages__: RequireJS supports loading modules that are in a [CommonJS Packages directory](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.1) structure, but some additional configuration needs to be specified for it to work. Specifically, there is support for the following CommonJS Packages features:
	>
	> * A package can be associated with a module name/prefix.
	> * The package config can specify the following properties for a specific package:
	>	* __name__: The name of the package (used for the module name/prefix mapping)
	>	* __location__: The location on disk. Locations are relative to the baseUrl configuration value, unless they contain a protocol or start with a front slash (/).
	>	* __main__: The name of the module inside the package that should be used when someone does a require for "packageName". The default value is "main", so only specify it if it differs from the default. The value is relative to the package folder.
	>
	> There's further information available in the RequireJS documentation about [Loading Modules from Packages](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#packages).

*	```javascript
	"deps": [ "require", "jquery"],
	```

	Load `require` and `jquery` as the very first dependencies

	> __deps__: An array of dependencies to load. This is useful when require is defined as a config object before require.js is loaded, and you want to specify dependencies to load as soon as require() is defined.
	
*	```javascript
	"callback" : function Boot (contextRequire, jQuery) {
	```

	The callback that will be called after __deps__ have been resolved (in this case called `Boot`).

	> A function to execute after __deps__ have been loaded. Useful when require is defined as a config object before require.js is loaded, and you want to specify a function to require after the configuration's __deps__ array has been loaded.

*	```javascript
	contextRequire([ "troopjs-dom/application/widget", "troopjs-dom/hash/widget", "troopjs-dom/loom/plugin"],
		function Strap(Application, HashWidget) {
	```

	Load the application widget together with any other components to be instantiated. Here we're loading:

	 - the hash widget for monitoring hash changes on our custom DOM event `hashchange` that publishes to `route/change`
	 - the loom plugin for jquery that addes `$.weave` and `$.unweave` and `$.woven`

	once that is completed call the `Strap` function.

*	```javascript
	jQuery(function($) {
		Application($("html"), "bootstrap", HashWidget($(window))).start();
	});
	```
	Upon `DOMContentLoaded`, create and attach the `bootstrap` application to `$("html")` and add a `HashWidget`
	attached to `$(window)` as a child. Then **start** the root application along with all child components.

Now we've configure our application to use RequireJS and set up the application entry point.

### Adding some widgets

Lets go back and look at [`index.html`](index.html). We want to try to break out functionality into small (somewhat self-contained) widgets, and the natural place to start is adding and displaying todo items.

>	There are three main classes of modules in TroopJS
>
>	*	`component`s are the base building block of anything TroopJS
>	*	`gadget`s extend `component`s with methods like `publish` and `subscribe`
>	*	`widget`s extend `gadget`s with UI related methods like `html` and `after`

Let's do this by adding _weave_ instructions in the HTML using `data-weave` attributes.

*	```html
	<input id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?" autofocus data-weave="troopjs-todos/widget/create">
	```

*	```html
	<ul id="todo-list" data-weave="troopjs-todos/widget/list">
	```

>	TroopJS _weaves_ widgets to the DOM by traversing it and finding elements that have a `data-weave` attribute. When weaving an element TroopJS will:
>
>	* Locate (and if needed async load) the module containing the widget
>	* Instantiate the widget and attach the jQuery wrapped DOM element to the created instance
>	* Wire the instance (basically reflect on the instance and scan for well-known method signatures), more on this later

If you look at the modified [`index.html`](index.html) you can locate all the widgets simply by searching for the `data-weave` attribute on any element.

#### [Create widget](widget/create.js)

The first widget to deal with is the create widget

> Widgets are named after where they are located (relative to `baseUrl`) in the source tree. A general rule is to simply add `.js` to the widget name to locate the file, so `widget/create` can be found in `widget/create.js`

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-dom/component/widget" ], function CreateModule(Widget) {
	"use strict";

	var ENTER_KEY = 13;

	return Widget.extend({
		"dom/keyup": function onKeyUp($event) {
			var me = this;
			var $element = me.$element;
			var value;

			if ($event.keyCode === ENTER_KEY) {
				value = $element.val().trim();

				if (value !== "") {
					me.publish("todos/add", value)
						.then(function () {
							$element.val("");
						});
				}
			}
		}
	});
});
```

Let's go through this widget

*	```javascript
	define([ "troopjs-dom/component/widget" ], function CreateModule(Widget) {
	```

	Start the definition of this module and declare its dependencies. The module is (internally) named `CreateModule` and it depends on `troopjs-dom/component/widget` which will be available inside the module as `Widget`

	> If you look above in `index.html` you'll find a package definition for `troopjs-dom` that points to `bower_components/troopjs-dom`.

*	```javascript
	"use strict";
	```

	Be strict.

*	```javascript
	var ENTER_KEY = 13;
	```

	Declare a constant for `ENTER_KEY` corresponding to the `keyCode` of enter.

*	```javascript
	return Widget.extend({
	```

	The result of this module is extending `Widget`

*	```javascript
	"dom/keyup" : function onKeyUp($event) {
	```

	This is where wiring becomes important. As mentioned above, wiring scans for well-known method signatures, and `dom/*` is one of these. In this instance, we're indicating that we want to add a handler for the DOM `keyup` event.

	> For DOM handlers, the first argument is the original jQuery event object.

*	```javascript
	var me = this;
	var $element = me.$element;
	var value;

	if ($event.keyCode === ENTER_KEY) {
		value = $element.val().trim();

		if (value !== "") {
			me.publish("todos/add", value)
				.then(function () {
					$element.val("");
				});
		}
	}
	```

	*	Save `this` as `me` so we can use it inside of closures
	*	Save `me.$element` (woven element) as `$element`
	*	Check if the `keyCode` of the event was enter
		* Store the trimmed value of the element as `value`
		* `publish` `value` on `todos/add`
		* Once all handlers are completed, reset `$element`.

#### [Count widget](widget/count.js)

Next we'll take a look at the count widget. This widget shows a counter that informs the user of how many active items are in the list.

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-dom/component/widget", "poly/array" ], function CountModule(Widget) {
	"use strict";

	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && !item.completed;
	}

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
			var count = items.filter(filter).length;

			this.$element.html("<strong>" + count + "</strong> " + (count === 1 ? "item" : "items") + " left");
		}
	});
});
```

Let's look at what new things we can find.

*	```javascript
	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && !item.completed;
	}
	```

	A static filter later used by `$.grep` to count active items.

*	```javascript
	"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
	```

	Again with the well-known signatures. This signature tells TroopJS that we want to add a subscription to the `todos/change` topic, _and_ that if a previous value was published on this topic _before_ we added our subscription, we'd like to get a callback with that value (this is what `:memory` adds to the mix).

*	```javascript
	var count = items.filter(filter).length;
	```

	This filters the list to only contain active items. After that we count the number of items in the array and store as `count`.

*	```javascript
	this.$element.html("<strong>" + count + "</strong> " + (count === 1 ? "item" : "items") + " left");
	```

	Update the `$element` HTML with a pluralized (if needed) text indicating what the current `count` is.

#### [Clear widget](widget/clear.js)

The clear widget is quite similar to the count widget, but the opposite. Instead of counting the number of active items in the list, it counts the number of completed items in the list.

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-dom/component/widget", "poly/array" ], function ClearModule(Widget) {
	"use strict";

	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && item.completed;
	}

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
			var count = items.filter(filter).length;

			this.$element.text("Clear completed (" + count + ")").toggle(count > 0);
		},

		"dom/click" : function onClear() {
			this.publish("todos/clear");
		}
	});
});
```

What looks different here?

*	```javascript
	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null && item.completed;
	}
	```

	Almost the same filter as before, but this time for completed items.

*	```javascript
	this.$element.text("Clear completed (" + count + ")").toggle(count > 0);
	```

	Update the `$element` HTML with a pluralized (if needed) text indicating what the current `count` is `toggle`.

*	```javascript
	"dom/click" : function onClear() {
		this.publish("todos/clear");
	}
	```

	Register a click handler that will publish `todos/clear` on the pubsub every time it is invoked.

#### [Mark widget](widget/mark.js)

The mark widget can do two things

* It allows the user to mark all the items as either completed or active with one click
* It shows the aggregate status of all the items in the list
  * __Unchecked__ if _no_ items are completed
  * __Checked__ if _all_ items are completed
  * __Indedeterminate__ if _some_ items are completed

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-dom/component/widget", "jquery", "poly/array" ], function MarkModule(Widget, $) {
	"use strict";

	return Widget.extend({
		"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
			var total = 0;
			var completed = 0;
			var $element = this.$element;

			items.forEach(function (item) {
				if (item === null) {
					return;
				}

				if (item.completed) {
					completed++;
				}

				total++;
			});

			if (completed === 0) {
				$element
					.prop("indeterminate", false)
					.prop("checked", false);
			}
			else if (completed === total) {
				$element
					.prop("indeterminate", false)
					.prop("checked", true);
			}
			else {
				$element
					.prop("indeterminate", true)
					.prop("checked", false);
			}
		},

		"dom/change" : function onMark($event) {
			this.publish("todos/mark", $($event.target).prop("checked"));
		}
	});
});
```

Let's start with the first item, showing an aggregate status

*	```javascript
	"hub:memory/todos/change" : function onChange(items) {
	```

	First register a handler for `todos/change`. You should recognize this by now as any widget interesting in changes of the list have handlers registered for this topic.

*	```javascript
	var total = 0;
	var completed = 0;
	var $element = this.$element;

	items.forEach(function (item) {
		if (item === null) {
			return;
		}

		if (item.completed) {
			completed++;
		}

		total++;
	});
	```

	Iterate `items` to determine how many non `null` items are there in `total` and how many of them are `completed`.

*	```javascript
	if (completed === 0) {
		$element
			.prop("indeterminate", false)
			.prop("checked", false);
	}
	else if (completed === total) {
		$element
			.prop("indeterminate", false)
			.prop("checked", true);
	}
	else {
		$element
			.prop("indeterminate", true)
			.prop("checked", false);
	}
	```

	Update the `$element` `indeterminate` and `checked` properties to reflect the result.

And then the second item - batch interaction:

*	```javascript
	"dom/change" : function onMark($event) {
		this.publish("todos/mark", $($event.target).prop("checked"));
	}
	```

	Register a change handler that will publish `todos/mark` on the pubsub with the current `checked` status of the checkbox as an argument.

#### [Filters widget](widget/filters.js)

The filters widget reflects the current filter status and allows the user to apply filters to the list.

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-dom/component/widget", "jquery" ], function FiltersModule(Widget, $) {
	"use strict";

	return Widget.extend({
		"route/change/:state?" : function onRoute(uri, matches) {
			this.publish("todos/filter", matches.state || "all");
		},

		"hub:memory/todos/filter" : function onFilter(filter) {
			$("a[href^='#']")
				.removeClass("selected")
				.filter("[class='" + state + "']")
				.addClass("selected");
		}
	});
});
```

Let's take a closer look

*	```javascript
	"route/change/:state?" : function onRoute(uri, matches) {
		this.publish("todos/filter", matches.state || "all");
	},
	```

	This will register a route handler that will be called whenever the hash (anything after `#` in the url)
	changes matches the pattern `:state?`. Arguments of the handler function is consist of both the `route` parameter,
	and a `matches` object where you can lookup all all route variables and their corresponding matches,
	eventually it will publish the criteria through hub topic `todos/filter`.

*	```javascript
	"hub:memory/todos/filter" : function onFilter(filter) {
		$("a[href^='#']")
			.removeClass("selected")
			.filter("[class='" + state + "']")
			.addClass("selected");
	}
	```

	Create a handler for the `todos/filter` hub topic which matches the filter by state class name, add or remove the `selected` css class (depending on if the filter matches).

#### [Display widget](widget/display.js)

The display widget shows or hides its contents depending on the status of the list

```javascript
define([ "troopjs-dom/component/widget", "poly/array" ], function DisplayModule(Widget) {
	"use strict";

	function filter(item) {
		return item !== null;
	}

	return Widget.extend({
	});
});
```

Quite simply it registers a handler for `todos/change` that will `toggle` depending on the result of `items.some`.

#### [List widget](widget/list.js)

The list widget is where all the magic happens. It is by far the largest widget and it contains all the logic that deals with the list.
